# üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Releasing

## Release Steps
1. Navigate to [Github released](https://github.com/tkww/TKMarketplace/releases) and determine `LAST_RELEASE`
   1. Find release with label `Latest release`
   2. `LAST_RELEASE` is the value next to the tag emoji, presented as üè∑Ô∏è
2. Run changelog generator from root of application
  ```bash
    # Replace LAST_RELEASE with value determined on step 1
    make generate_release_notes last_release=LAST_RELEASE  
  ```
3. Determine version number with the following syntax `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
     - Previous release should be reference to determine new version number
     - `MAJOR` should be incremented at the discretion of the team
       - It is primarily used when large features are being released
       - `MINOR` and `PATCH` should be set to `0`
     - `MINOR` should be incremented when release contains any branches tagged with `feature` or `chore`
       - `MAJOR` should not be changed
       - `PATCH` should be set to `0`
     - `PATCH` should be incremented in all other cases
       - `MAJOR` and `MINOR` should not be changed
4. Draft a new release through Github web UI
   1. Navigate to [Draft Release Page](https://github.com/tkww/TKMarketplace/releases/new)
   2. Populate form
   
     | Field                 | Value                                                                                                                                                                           |
     | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
     | Tag Version           | `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, ex: `v1.2.3`                                                                                                                                              |
     | Target                | `develop`                                                                                                                                                                       |
     | Release Title         | A one line description of all code being released                                                                                                                               |
     | Describe this release | The output of the changelog generator, excluding all but `New Features Added`, `Fixed bugs` and `Merged pull requests` (everything below line 6, not including final two lines) |

5. A release branch should be cut off the current HEAD of the `develop` branch and follow this flow to release to staging
   1. Checkout `develop` and pull latest HEAD locally
      ```bash
      git checkout develop
      git pull
        ```
   2. Checkout new branch with the following syntax
      ```bash
      git checkout -b release/marketplace-web-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
      ```
   3. Push branch to origin to trigger CI/CD deploy to staging
      ```bash
      git push --set-upstream origin release/marketplace-web-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
      ```
6. Notify team of changes to staging
   1. Ensure release is on staging through [Jenkins Activity Log](https://pipelines.eng.theknotww.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/tkww%2FTKMarketplace/activity)
   2. Create message Slack
      - Populate message using the following syntax
      - `Tag Version` is on staging`, where `Tag Version` is the value populated when drafting release
        - Copy value in `Describe this release` from drafting release and wrap in code block with three backticks `` ``` ``
      - Tag message with key stakeholders
        - Engineering Team: `@mktpl-fe-eng`
        - QA Engineer: `@rchandler`
        - Product Manager: `@Gian-mical (GM)`
      - Post message to [marketplace-internal](https://theknotww.slack.com/archives/GBLPF9KNU)
7. Deploy Release 
   1. Wait for both QA Engineer and Product Manager to sign off on release
      If issues are presented, administer hotfix, [see below](#hotfixes) 
   2. Post message to [marketplace-internal](https://theknotww.slack.com/archives/GBLPF9KNU) with the value of `Deploying to Production`. Samuel Jackson wishes you luck
   3. Checkout release branch and pull latest HEAD to ensure there are no local changes
      ```bash
      git checkout release/marketplace-web-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
      git pull
      ```
   4. Checkout `main` branch and pull latest HEAD
      ```bash
      git checkout main
      git pull
      ```
   5. Merge release branch into `main`
      ```bash
      git merge release/marketplace-web-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
      ```
   6. Do not modify commit message, simply `ESCAPE` ‚Üí `w` ‚Üí `q` ‚Üí `ENTER`
   7. Push release to production üôå
      ```bash
      git push
      ```
8. Merge release branch into `develop`

      ```bash
      git checkout release/marketplace-web-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
      git pull
      ```
    1. Checkout `develop` branch and pull latest HEAD
      ```bash
      git checkout develop
      git pull
      ```
    2. Merge release branch into `develop`
      ```bash
      git merge release/marketplace-web-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
      ```
    3.  Do not modify commit message, simply `ESCAPE` `w` `q` `ENTER`
    4.  Push updated `develop` branch
      ```bash
      git push
      ```

## Hotfixes
Releases on staging that is being reviewed may present issues to the QA engineer or product manager. This will require a hotfix to be created and deployed
1. Checkout release branch with issues and pull latest HEAD
2. Checkout new branch with the following syntax `hotfix/ISSUE_PRESENTED` where `ISSUE_PRESENTED` is a brief description of the problem being solved, separated by dashes
3. Complete fix
4. Checkout release branch with issues and pull latest HEAD
5. Merge hotfix branch into release branch
